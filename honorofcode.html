                <p> <br>After introducing ADA university, we started talking about Code.org. The students were very interested in it and we introduced them to coding as much as possible. We looked at several problems with the students and analyzed how they would solve them by giving them difficult codes. The students were very successful in deciphering the codes and finding the way out. Through Code.org, several students have found their interests and determined their future careers. We were proud to have both us and Code.org involved in the children's decisions.<br><br>The collaborative effort between ADA University and Code.org was instrumental in inspiring and guiding these students. As educators, it was a source of pride to witness the positive influence on their decisions and the profound impact on their trajectories.</p>
